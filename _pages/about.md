I am a third-year **PhD candidate in Computational Science** at Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), under the mentoring of **Prof. Ernst C. Wit**.

My research focuses on **network science**, particularly on the **statistical modeling of time-stamped relational data** 📊. 
I specialize in developing methodological advances for relational event models 👥⏱️.

I also contribute to outreach for USI’s Data Science Bachelor program 👩‍💻.

I hold BSc and MSc degrees in Statistical Sciences (cum laude) from University of Bologna 🇮🇹, and have received several grants, including Erasmus+ at Université Paris 2 🇫🇷, SEMP grant at USI 🇨🇭, and NGI Enrichers Fellowship at McGill University 🇨🇦.
